<p><strong><span style="font-size:16px">Any assumptions or decisions made during the development</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>In the features section, I presumed that cards were exclusively implemented in the desktop version, while the mobile version was represented by a PNG file. As it turns out, this assumption precisely matches their approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Challenges</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>It was difficult to create the cards under rail ecosystem and features sections.</li>
	<li>Creating the globe was difficult and I had to make some research about it. Found out that the language needed to create such is three.js.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Solutions</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>With painstaking effort, I was able to create the cards and implemented them accordingly.</li>
	<li>Since three.js is not part of my tech stack, I had to look for a way to incorporate the globe by using the globe image and i am willing to learn three.js.</li>
</ul>
